0.) Set up your CASA environment:
   - In your BASH terminal, the following, replacing the path to the reduction directory appropriately, i.e.,
     with the folder that contains this file and `split_windows.py`:
     $ export ALMAIMF_ROOTDIR=/path/to/the/directory/containing/this/file
   - Start CASA
   - Install astropy stuff.  Follow the instructions at http://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/install.html#installing-astropy-into-casa
   - Install a little more python stuff:
   >>> import subprocess
   >>> subprocess.check_call([sys.executable, '-m', 'pip', 'install', '--user',
                              'cython',
                              'https://github.com/astropy/regions/archive/master.zip',
                              'https://github.com/radio-astro-tools/spectral-cube/archive/master.zip'])
   - Restart CASA

1.) Run the pipeline with DOSPLIT=True to restore the measurement sets.  You can use this script:
https://github.com/ALMA-IMF/reduction/blob/master/reduction/run_pipeline.py
to automatically run all scriptForPI.py files in subdirectories.

2.) Run split_windows.py (see instructions in that file) to create the continuum measurement sets.

3.) Read https://github.com/ALMA-IMF/notebooks/blob/master/SelfCal_Instructions_Examination.ipynb,
which goes into detail on how to image and create masks.

4.) Modify ``imaging_parameters.py`` and submit the change as a pull request.
    Most likely, you need to add the name of your target field (e.g., G008.67, W51-E, W43-MM2)
    to the line saying "for field in ...".  DO NOT delete the other field names!

5.) Run continuum_imaging.py:
    - Set EXCLUDE_7M=True on the command line or ``exclude_7m=True`` within python if you do
    not want to include the 7m data.
    If and when it crashes because you do not have an appropriately named
    region file, make a region file following the naming scheme given in
    https://github.com/ALMA-IMF/notebooks/blob/master/SelfCal_Instructions_Examination.ipynb
    (if you can't see that website on github, try loading it in http://nbviewer.jupyter.org)


6.) Run continuum_imaging_selfcal.py
    This file runs based off of the parameters set in the file https://github.com/ALMA-IMF/reduction/blob/master/reduction/imaging_parameters.py.
    It requires that either ds9 or CASA CRTF region files specifying the masks are created as described in
    https://github.com/ALMA-IMF/notebooks/blob/master/SelfCal_Instructions_Examination.ipynb



Additional Details of the Directory Structure
=============================================
There are two directory structures to pay attention to: the code tree and the
data tree.

The data tree will be wherever you download the ALMA data and extract the tar
files; it must be on a file system with a lot of free space.  When you extract
the tar files, a directory called "2017.1.01355.L" will be created: that is
where you should run the various scripts described here.  When you run the
imaging scripts, a subdirectory called "imaging_results/" will be created, and
that will contain all of the resulting image files.

The code tree can go anywhere.  The ALMAIMF_ROOTDIR environmental variable,
described above, should point to the "reduction/" directory that contains all
of the important scripts (i.e., this directory:
https://github.com/ALMA-IMF/reduction/tree/master/reduction).

When you create mask region files, they belong in $ALMAIMF_ROOTDIR/clean_regions/.


Additional tricks of cleaning in selfcal
=============================================
Be conservative in making the first image before the first iteration of the selfcal.
That is, clean relatively shallow probably by setting the threshold to be
4 times rms or a bit greater. Otherwise, some artefacts may be introduced into the final
image. In the later iterations (e.g., from iter2, 3, ...,) of selfcal, the threshold can be
constrained down to 2 times rms.

Scales in band3 could be set larger than those in band6, which is demonstrated for the 
source G353.41, for example, scales = [0, 3, 9, 27] in band3 but scales = [0, 3, 9] in band6. 
Note that the scales are ought to be in a reasonable range, i.e., smaller than
or comparable to the size the largest mask, otherwise, the final image could be distorted.

In each selfcal, the threshold and the region mask could be changeable due to the rms varying
with each selfcal. So, it is recommend to change them following your previous criteria 
on the threshold and region mask. 

The mask can be made with different criteria for dense and diffuse regions. For example, 
the dense regions can be masked out with a contour of 4*rms, but the diffuse regions can be done with 3*rms. 
Checking the residual image from the right previous selfcal is always useful to make a good mask for a good 
cleaning that could result in a more flatter residual image in the next iteration of selfcal.

After each selfcal, it is recommended to count the immediate maximum flux density and rms, 
to calculate the dynamical range, and finally to decide if further selfcals are needed by checking
how the maximum flux density runs (up for more selfcals, and down for no previous one, and further
selfcals).

As a rule of thumb, the phase selfcal is better to be done before the amplitude selfcal.
For the latter, be careful that the flux of the amp-selfcalibrated image would suffer from
a flux decrease.
