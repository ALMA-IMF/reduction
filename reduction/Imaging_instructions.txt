      additional notes are in the python scripts -

12.12.2018: As of today, this has only been tested on B3 images.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

0.) Set up your CASA environment:
   - In your BASH terminal, the following, replacing the path to the reduction directory appropriately, i.e.,
     with the folder that contains this file and `split_windows.py`:
     $ export ALMAIMF_ROOTDIR=/path/to/the/directory/containing/this/file
   - Start CASA
   - Install astropy stuff.  Follow the instructions at http://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/install.html#installing-astropy-into-casa
   - Install a little more python stuff:
   >>> import subprocess
   >>> subprocess.check_call([sys.executable, '-m', 'pip', 'install', '--user',
                              'cython',
                              'https://github.com/astropy/regions/archive/master.zip',
                              'https://github.com/radio-astro-tools/spectral-cube/archive/master.zip'])
   - Restart CASA

1.) Run split_windows.py (see instructions in that file).

2.) Run continuum_imaging.py
    If and when it crashes, make a region file...?


3.) Copy a single cont.dat in a directory ../calibration/
	=> This should contain all line-free channels to image for the cleanest possible images. At a first order you can use the one provided by the pipeline. However, if you think this needs adjustments, please select/modify this file on your own.

(Set or not the exclude_7m shell variable. It should be possible to do this later in the CASA session as well. See documentation on this within the scripts.)

4.) In CASA:
	import sys
	sys.path.append('.')
	execfile 'split_windows.py' 
		=> by default, this will give you all the spws and 
		   continuum ms files for imaging with the 7m dataset included

	execfile 'continuum_imaging_both.py'
		=> This will do the continuum imaging in two steps: 
			- first it creates the 'cleanest' continuum image based on your cont.dat input excluding channels with line emission
			- then it creates the 'best sensitivity' continuum image using the broad bandwidth (> 2000km/s) spws 1,2,3 for Band 3 (this excludes spw 0 with the N2H+ line), and spw 7 and 8 for Band 6 (using the continuum unit, and the second broadest band unit with 600 km/s width including the 13CS and N2D+ lines*.
			- the imaging is done with a set of robust parameters -2, 0, 2
			- the CLEAN is currently INTERACTIVE. This is because the auto-thresholding gives poor results. In the script you find some parameters that allowed for my field to get a better mask, but these parameters may not work so well for other regions.

At the end: you should find 6 images in the ./imaging_results directory.


Note: If you image first the 12m+7m dataset together (i.e. you do not set the exclude_7m variable), and then you want to image only the 12m dataset, you need to first step the exclude_7m variable and then execute continuum_imaging_both.py again!  (you do not need to re-run split_windows.py)

*: the total bandwidth in B6 is: 1875+2*468.75+3*234.38+2*117.19 MHz = 3750.02 MHz. What we currently use is: 1875+468.75 = 2343.75 MHz. Including all the spws would therefore only allow us to gain ~25% more in sensitivity, while it would include potentially strong lines.
