    - instructions written by T. Csengeri, modified by A. Ginsburg,
      additional notes are in the python scripts -

0.) Set up your CASA environment:
   - In your BASH terminal, the following, replacing the path to the reduction directory appropriately, i.e.,
     with the folder that contains this file and `split_windows.py`:
     $ export ALMAIMF_ROOTDIR=/path/to/the/directory/containing/this/file
   - Start CASA
   - Install astropy stuff.  Follow the instructions at http://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/install.html#installing-astropy-into-casa
   - Install a little more python stuff:
   >>> import subprocess
   >>> subprocess.check_call([sys.executable, '-m', 'pip', 'install', '--user',
                              'cython',
                              'https://github.com/astropy/regions/archive/master.zip',
                              'https://github.com/radio-astro-tools/spectral-cube/archive/master.zip'])
   - Restart CASA

1.) Run split_windows.py (see instructions in that file).

2.) Modify ``imaging_parameters.py`` and submit the change as a pull request.
    Most likely, you need to add the name of your target field (e.g., G008.67, W51-E, W43-MM2)
    to the line saying "for field in ...".  DO NOT delete the other field names!

3.) Run continuum_imaging.py:
    - Set EXCLUDE_7M=True on the command line or ``exclude_7m=True`` within python if you do
    not want to include the 7m data.
    If and when it crashes because you do not have an appropriately named
    region file, make a region file following the naming scheme given in
    https://github.com/ALMA-IMF/notebooks/blob/master/SelfCal_Instructions_Examination.ipynb
    (if you can't see that website on github, try loading it in http://nbviewer.jupyter.org)


4.) Run continuum_imaging_selfcal.py
    This file runs based off of the parameters set in the
