			Template scripts for continuum imaging

	- scripts written by A. Ginsburg with minor modifications by T. Csengeri -
    - instructions written by T. Csengeri, modified by A. Ginsburg,
      additional notes are in the python scripts -

12.12.2018: As of today, this has only been tested on B3 images.
27.05.2019: A. Ginsburg made substantial modifications during & after f2f meeting in Grenoble

0.) Set up your CASA environment:
   - In your BASH terminal, the following, replacing the path to the reduction directory appropriately, i.e.,
     with the folder that contains this file and `split_windows.py`:
     $ export ALMAIMF_ROOTDIR=/path/to/the/directory/containing/this/file
   - Start CASA
   - Install astropy stuff.  Follow the instructions at http://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/install.html#installing-astropy-into-casa
   - Install a little more python stuff:
   >>> import subprocess
   >>> subprocess.check_call([sys.executable, '-m', 'pip', 'install', '--user',
                              'cython',
                              'https://github.com/astropy/regions/archive/v0.4.tar.gz',
                              'https://github.com/radio-astro-tools/spectral-cube/archive/master.zip'])
   - Restart CASA

1.) Run the pipeline with DOSPLIT=True to restore the measurement sets.  You can use this script:
https://github.com/ALMA-IMF/reduction/blob/master/reduction/run_pipeline.py
to automatically run all scriptForPI.py files in subdirectories.

2.) Run split_windows.py (see instructions in that file) to create the continuum measurement sets.

3.) Read https://github.com/ALMA-IMF/notebooks/blob/master/SelfCal_Instructions_Examination.ipynb,
which goes into detail on how to image and create masks.

4.) Modify ``imaging_parameters.py`` and submit the change as a pull request.
    Most likely, you need to add the name of your target field (e.g., G008.67, W51-E, W43-MM2)
    to the line saying "for field in ...".  DO NOT delete the other field names!

5.) Run continuum_imaging.py:
    - Set EXCLUDE_7M=True on the command line or ``exclude_7m=True`` within python if you do
    not want to include the 7m data.
    If and when it crashes because you do not have an appropriately named
    region file, make a region file following the naming scheme given in
    https://github.com/ALMA-IMF/notebooks/blob/master/SelfCal_Instructions_Examination.ipynb
    (if you can't see that website on github, try loading it in http://nbviewer.jupyter.org)


6.) Run continuum_imaging_selfcal.py
    This file runs based off of the parameters set in the file https://github.com/ALMA-IMF/reduction/blob/master/reduction/imaging_parameters.py.
    It requires that either ds9 or CASA CRTF region files specifying the masks are created as described in
    https://github.com/ALMA-IMF/notebooks/blob/master/SelfCal_Instructions_Examination.ipynb



Additional Details of the Directory Structure
=============================================
There are two directory structures to pay attention to: the code tree and the
data tree.

The data tree will be wherever you download the ALMA data and extract the tar
files; it must be on a file system with a lot of free space.  When you extract
the tar files, a directory called "2017.1.01355.L" will be created: that is
where you should run the various scripts described here.  When you run the
imaging scripts, a subdirectory called "imaging_results/" will be created, and
that will contain all of the resulting image files.

The code tree can go anywhere.  The ALMAIMF_ROOTDIR environmental variable,
described above, should point to the "reduction/" directory that contains all
of the important scripts (i.e., this directory:
https://github.com/ALMA-IMF/reduction/tree/master/reduction).

When you create mask region files, they belong in $ALMAIMF_ROOTDIR/clean_regions/.
